            that have long contributed to appeal the tourist destination and acts as important marketing tool to attract tourist especially 
            with special interests in heritage and arts. Cultural heritage tourism has emerged as a potential form of alternative tourism 
            among both international tourists as well as Malaysian domestic travelers. The difference of ethnics present in Malaysia brought 
            different local knowledge discipline ranging from its <span style="color: blue;">architecture, handicrafts, traditional attire, music and dance</span>, which

          Ayer Itam, it is the largest Buddhist temple in Malaysia and an important pilgrimage centre for Buddhists from Hong Kong, 
          the Philippines, Singapore and other parts of Southeast Asia. The entire complex of temples was built over a period from 
          1890 to 1930, an inspirational initiative of Beow Lean, the abbot. The main feature of the complex is the seven-story Ten 
          Thousand Buddhas Pagoda built by the late Thai king Rama VI, featuring 10,000 alabaster and bronze statues of Buddha and 
          the 36.57-metre-tall (120 ft) bronze statue of Guanyin (Kuan Yin), the Goddess of Mercy. The 10,000 Buddhas concept 
          belongs to the Chinese Mahāyāna school of Buddhism while Rama VI was king over a Theravāda country and Buddhist tradition.
          Mahayana Buddhism, Theravada Buddhism and traditional Chinese rituals blend into a harmonious whole, both in the temple 
          architecture and artwork as well as in the daily activities of worshippers.

          consists of several large prayer halls and pavilions for assembly and prayer, statues of Buddha; various bodhisattvas 
          as well as Chinese deities are being venerated. The architectural features include carved pillars, fine woodwork, 
          mostly painted in bright colours, and a plethora of lanterns add to the visual impression. Fish ponds and flower gardens 
          are also part of the temple complex. There are two tiers of double-lane inclined elevators to carry pilgrims and visitors 
          further uphill. An electric buggy service links the different tiers of elevators as their middle levels are some distance 
          apart. On the elevated platform, there is a fish pond, and the towering statue of Kuan Yin, Goddess of Mercy, beseeched 
          by women hoping to have children. Monks and nuns reside in a monastery.

          feet (13 m). The ceiling rises to 40 feet (12 m) and is spanned by wooden beams, each carved from a single tree. 
          The roof is covered with Dutch tiles and the walls were raised using Dutch bricks built on local laterite blocks then 
          coated with Chinese plaster. The floors of the church are paved with granite blocks originally used as ballast for

          The church is built with a combination of Neo-Classical, Georgian and English Palladian architecture styles. Built 
          entirely by Indian convict labour, it was built of brick on a solid plastered stone base. The Church features a portico 
          of Doric columns. The original roof was flat but was converted to a gable in 1864 as the original flat roof was found to 
          be unsuitable in the tropical climate. The apex of the roof is topped by an octagonal shaped steeple. A memorial pavilion 
          was erected in 1886 in memory of Captain Francis Light during the Centenary Celebrations of the founding of modern Penang.
          In 2007, the church was declared one of the 50 National Treasures of Malaysia by the Malaysian federal government. 
          It underwent a major restoration in 2009.
