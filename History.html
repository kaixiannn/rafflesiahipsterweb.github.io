        It is said that Malaysian history began with the Malacca Sultanate around 1400 AD.
        In its heyday, the sultanate's territory was around the Malay Peninsula and the east coast of Sumatra. 
        Malacca has become a respected government due to its location at the crossroads of East Asia and the Middle East.
        This made Malacca an important center for the spice trade, especially in Southeast Asia. 
        Islam is the main religion that emerged and became the main religion of people due to the ruler himself following this religion.

        In 1511, Malacca fell to Portugal and the colonization of Malacca began. 
        Later, Malaya was taken over by the Dutch with the Anglo-Dutch Treaty in 1641 and by the British in 1824.
        Britian had colonial rule longer than other countries.
        The British, with the help of the state nobility, unified all branches of the Malay government previously under the control of the Malay rulers.
        British intervention caused discontent among the local population.
        Some people rebelled against colonialism in, but they were easily defeated by the British because their power was personal.
        Heroes who fought against the colonialists include Dol Said, Tok Janggut, Datuk Bahaman, Remtap, Dato Maharajalela, Rosli Dobi, etc.

        In the 1920s and 1930s, many Malaysians began studying in the Middle East or the region.
        All in all, this knowledgeable group looks to be fighting for the national championship.
        They use newspapers, magazines and other media to spread thierideology.
        Some also formed organizations such as the Kesatuan Melayu Muda (KMM) and Kesatuan Malayu Singapura (KMS) to repel the invaders and establish their own governments.
        Although the people of that country were very interested in stopping the invassion, they were shocked when the Japanese fell in late 1941 and Malaya entered a new colonial era.

        Japan's withdrawal paved the way for the Communist Party of Malaya (PKM) to take control of Malaya. 
        The PKM launched an unprovoked attack in Malaya, killing three European rubber plantation leaders in Hoa Fong, Perak. 
        Therefore, in June 1948, Sir Edward Gent announced  that the situation in Malaya was unusual.

        The rise of Tunku Abdul Rahman brought a ray of hope to the struggle for Malaysian nationalism. 
        The work of establishing the Unity Part began to open the eyes of the British and give the Malays the authority to govern their country.
        Unity between the three main ethnic groups, Malays, Chinese and Indians, led to the signing of the Treaty of London on 8 February 1956 and the Malaysian Declaration of Independence on 31 August 1957.
        Following Tunku Abdul Rahman's return from London on 20 February 1956, Tunku declared the independence of Malaya at Bandar Sirir, Padang, Malacca.
        On 27 May 1961, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Haji proposed merging the five colonies - Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak and Brunei - to form a new country.
