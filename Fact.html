          In contrast to Queen Elizabeth II, who assumed the throne at birth, King Abdul Halim of Kedah was chosen to rule Malaysia in December 2011. 
          In Malaysia, the king is chosen by the Conference of Rulers to lead the nation for a period of five years. 
          The sultans of the nation, who receive their titles from their fathers, comprise the Conference of Rulers.

          Malaysia is home to the world's largest cave chamber. Enormous in size, 
          the Sarawak Chamber in Gunung Mulu National Park can accommodate forty to fifty Boeing 747s.
          It's another matter completely whether or not you could actually park these jets in the Sarawak Chamber.

          Taman Negara is the oldest tropical rainforest in the world, with an estimated age of over 130 million years. 
          In Malay, Taman Negara only translates to "national park." You must obtain special permission from the government in order to enter the park, but if you have the time, it is definitely worth it. 
          Rare creatures include the Malayan tiger, the crab-eating macaque, Sumatran rhinoceros, and even Asian elephants can be found in this rainforest.

            Malaysia is home to the parasitic flower genus Rafflesia. Not only is a rafflesia the largest flower in the world, measuring almost a metre in length across its cross section, but you can identify one by scent alone. A gigantic flower may not smell as lovely as you believe it does. It is compared to the stench of putrefaction.

            Another striking creature that can be found in Malaysia is the King Cobra. Not only is this the longest venomous snake in the world, but it was also discovered in Malaysia to be an amazing 5 metres and 71 centimetres long. The world's highest concentration of King Cobras is found in Malaysia.
