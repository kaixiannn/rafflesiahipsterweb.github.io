        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
            Malaysia is mainly composed of Malays, Chinese and Indians. The three major ethnic groups have their own unique 
            eating habits, so they have formed their own distinctive cuisines. Let's introduce Malaysian cuisine to you. For hundreds 
            of years, Malaysia has served as a rich melting pot of south-east Asian culture and ethnicities. Malaysia welcoming and 
            tolerant society has long since embraced these multi-ethnic influences and Malaysian food is no exception. Influences from 
            Chinese, Indian, Thai, Arab and ethnic Malay cooking give Malaysian food culture a truly unique edge over other national 
            cuisines and will immediately captivate the taste buds. The result is vibrant dishes with richness, spice, succulence but also 
            freshness.

        <h3 style ="font-family: cursive;">Malay Food Culture</h3>
        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Malay food is strong, spicy and aromatic, combining the rich tastes of the many herbs and spices commonly found in 
          Southeast Asia. It is one of three major cuisines in Malaysia, and together with Chinese and Indian food, continually 
          delight visitors to the country with its incredible variety and flavors. The Malays' qualities inform their cooking. 
          Food preparation can be a communal affair among the Malays and it is not uncommon during major festivals or events to 
          see neighbors in a kampong, or village gathered around a big pot stirring up beef rendang or chicken curry.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Malay food is often eaten with the hands. No implements are needed. Diners simply scoop mouthfuls of rice mixed with 
          curry, vegetables or meat onto their palms and then ladle this into their mouths with the back of their thumbs. It is 
          an art to keep the rice from escaping through the fingers but, with some practice, it can be mastered. Rice is the 
          staple in a Malay meal. And just as in many other Southeast Asian countries, it is usually eaten together with meat 
          and vegetable dishes, curries and condiments like the Malay sambal sauce. During a typical Malay lunch or dinner, these 
          dishes are placed in the center of the table to be shared by all the diners.

        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Nasi lemak is a dish originating in Malay cuisine that consists of fragrant rice cooked in coconut milk and pandan leaf. 
          It is commonly found in Malaysia, where it is considered as the national dish. It is also a native dish in 
          neighbouring areas with significant ethnic Malay populations such as Singapore and Southern Thailand. In Indonesia, 
          it can be found in several parts of Sumatra, especially the Malay regions of Riau, Riau Islands and Medan. It is 
          considered an essential dish for a typical Malay-style breakfast. Nasi lemak is featured as a national dish in most of 
          the country's tourism brochures and promotional materials.

        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Nasi kerabu is a Malaysian rice dish, a type of nasi ulam, in which blue-colored rice is eaten with dried fish or fried 
          chicken, crackers, pickles and other salads. The blue color of the rice comes from the petals of Clitoria ternatea 
          (butterfly-pea) flowers (bunga telang), which are used as a natural food coloring in cooking it. The rice can also 
          be plain white rice or rice cooked using turmeric. It is often eaten with solok lada (stuffed peppers) and is also eaten 
          with fried keropok

        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Satay is a Southeast Asian form of kebab made from seasoned, skewered and barbecued meat, served with a sauce. satay is 
          often served with peanut sauce, and is often accompanied with lontong or ketupat, both of which are similar types of 
          rice cake, though the diversity of the country has produced a wide variety of satay recipes. It is also popular in many 
          other Southeast Asian countries including Brunei, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore and Thailand. It is also 
          recognized and popular in Suriname and the Netherlands. In Sri Lanka, it has become a staple of the local diet 
          as a result of the influences from the local Malay community.

        <br>
        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Satay may consist of diced or sliced chicken, goat, mutton, beef, pork, fish, other meats, or tofu; bamboo skewers 
          are often used, while rustic style of preparations employ skewers from the midrib of the coconut palm frond. These are 
          grilled or barbecued over a wood or charcoal fire, then served with various spicy seasonings. Satay can be served in 
          various sauces; however, most often they are served in a combination of soy and peanut sauce. Hence, peanut sauce 
          is often called satay sauce. It is popular as street food, and it can be obtained from a travelling satay vendor, 
          from a street-side tent-restaurant, in an upper-class restaurant, or at traditional celebration feasts. Close analogues 
          are yakitori from Japan, kǎoròu chuàn from China, seekh kebab from the Indian Subcontinent, shish kebab from Turkey and 
          the Middle East, shashlik from Eastern Europe and the Caucasus, and sosatie from South Africa. It is listed at number 
          14 on World's 50 most delicious foods readers' poll compiled by CNN Go in 2011.

        <h3 style ="font-family: cursive;">Chinese Food Culture</h3>
        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Food is an important part of daily life for Chinese people. Chinese not only enjoy eating but believe eating good food 
          can bring harmony and closeness to the family and relationships. Chinese people in general are not as concerned about 
          nutrition as Western culture. They are more concerned with the food’s texture, flavor, color, and aroma. These are the 
          crucial points for good Chinese cooking. Chinese daily meals consist of four food groups: grains, vegetables, fruit, and 
          meat. Because of lactose intolerance, Chinese do not consume large amounts of dairy products. Instead, Chinese substitute 
          these with soymilk and tofu, which also contain large amounts of protein and calcium. Vegetables, fruits, and meats are 
          usually fresh. Some exceptions include preserved vegetables such as snow cabbage or mustard greens, preserved eggs, aka 
          “thousand year old eggs” or salted and dried fish. Other exceptions include snack items such as beef jerky, cuttlefish jerky, 
          sweet and sour preserved plums, or dehydrated mango slices. Canned or frozen foods are seldom eaten.

          The <span style="color: red;">Penang Hokkien Mee</span> can be easily distinguished from the other variants by its characteristic spicy prawn broth. 
          It primarily consists of rice vermicelli and thicker yellow egg noodles, while the broth is made with prawn heads and 
          shells, and pork ribs. Sliced prawns or shrimps are also added into the dish, along with pork slices, hard boiled 
          eggs, and kangkung. Some of the Hokkien Mee are served with bean sprouts, fried shallots, lard and 
          sambal too. In Penang, pig skin, an ingredient rarely served in Kuala Lumpur, is a common topping as well.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          Egg noodles are served in richly flavoured dark soup stock with prawns, pork slices, fish cake slices and bean sprouts, 
          topped with fried shallots and scallion. The stock is made using dried shrimp, plucked heads of prawns, white pepper, 
          garlic and other spices. Traditionally, lard is added to the soup, but this is now less common due to health concerns. 
          A "dry" (without soup) version is also available; this version usually involves flavouring the noodles and toppings with 
          vinegar, soy sauce, oil and chili, if desired. The dish is also usually served with freshly cut red chili slices in light 
          soy sauce and lime juice.

        <p style="color:darkcyan; font-family:cursive; line-height: 2.5; text-indent: 40px;">
          The name "Hokkien Mee" is controversial and often discussed in local forums. Majority of the Penangites and hawkers are 
          Hokkien who talked in Hokkien-dialect. Thus, the Hokkien prawn-soup noodle was called "Hokkien Mee" in Penang as there 
          are varieties of noodles with prawn as main ingredients such as "lam mee" while local Hokkien Mee was served with sliced 
          small shrimp. Nevertheless, not all Malaysian speaks hokkien. Theerefore, Penang Hokkien Mee is also known as "Penang Har 
          Mee" especially in other northern region which Cantonese was their most-spoken dialects, as "Har" means prawn in Cantonese 
          ("Hae" in Hokkien).

          It is a dish of thick yellow noodles braised in thick dark soy sauce with pork, squid, fish cake and cabbage as the 
          main ingredients and cubes of pork fat fried until crispy (sometimes pork liver is included). The best examples are 
          usually cooked over a raging charcoal fire. This dish originated from a hawker stall chef, Ong Kim Lian, at Petaling 
          Street in 1927.

          In Malaysia, nasi ayam (literally "chicken rice" in Bahasa Melayu) is "a culinary staple" and a popular street food, 
          particularly in Ipoh, a center of Hainanese immigration. The general term nasi ayam can refer to multiple variations

          by a variety of side dishes including steamed rice rather than seasoned 'oily' rice, soup, or chicken offal. In Malacca 
          and Muar, the rice is served in balls rather than in bowls; this dish is commonly known as Chicken rice balls. Steamed 
          rice is shaped into golf ball-sized orbs and served alongside the chopped chicken..

          The remarks of Indian culture had first seen in ancient times but exploded in the 15th century by trading. Besides, 
          during the colonial period, with the lack of labour, a large number of Indian Muslims had migrated to Malaysia with 
          their traditions, culture, and of course food. Famous Indian spices and cooking techniques were adopted easily to 
          Malaysia as the cuisine is based on Ayurveda. Ayurveda is known as the science of life by balancing the body with diet, 
          herbal treatment, and yogic breathing. Roti canai, nasi kandar, and mamak rojak can be shown as the examples regarding 
          this. The Malay Indian cuisine is essentially based on banana leaves, Chettinad cuisine, and Mamak culture. It means the 
          Malay-Indian combination is originated from South India, with ingredients that can also be found in Malaysia, and heavily 
          spiced cooking techniques.

          Biryani is a mixed rice dish, mainly popular in South Asia. It is made with rice, some type of meat 
          (chicken, goat, lamb, beef, prawn, or fish) and spices. To cater to vegetarians, in some cases, it is prepared by 
          substituting vegetables for the meat. Sometimes eggs and/or potatoes are also added. Biryani is one of the most popular 
          dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, although the dish is often associated with the region’s Muslim 
          population in particular. Similar dishes are also prepared in other parts of the world such as in Iraq, Myanmar, 
          Thailand, and Malaysia. Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, 
          and has been labelled as the most popular dish overall in India.

          The Malaysian variety of biryani is called nasi briyani or nasi biryani. Although authentic styles of 
          biryani from South India are popular, nasi briyani remains the most popular. The key differences between nasi briyani 
          and Indian biryanis are that the meat in nasi briyani is cooked separately from the rice, and there is more curry, sauce, 
          or gravy present in the nasi briyani than in Indian biryanis. Nasi briyani dishes are very popular in Malaysia. 
          As an important part of Malaysian Indian cuisines, they are popularized through mamak stalls,
