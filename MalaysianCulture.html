                    Malaysian Chinese(mostly Han-Chinese),who make up 22.6% of the Malaysian population,
                    they are descendants of laborers who immigrated to Malaysia during British colonial rule in the late 19th.
                    Malaysian Chinese generally display hard work and resilience.
                    This is because Chinese migrant have a common concept called "kiasu", which means fear of losing.
                    This concept had motivate them to achieve in economy and academic.
                    Therefore, Malaysian Chinese generally work hard to achieve what they want.

                <p>
                    However, they tend to not show overt aggression.
                    They usually remain calm and polite because they believe that forcefulness is considered discordant behavior.
                    Besides, Malaysian Chinese account for about 70% of the Malaysia economy.
                    Therefore, they are regarded as business-savvy ethnic group.
                    They make up large proportion of the upper class.
                    Many Malays view this as monopoly on corporate sector,
                    exacerbating underlying tension and mistrust between Malays and Malaysian

                    Malaysian Malays are the indigenous ethnicities.
                    They had made up 51% of the Malaysian population.
                    Most of them are Muslims which explain why this race also called "Muslims Malay".
                    As the most populous ethnic group, they dominate the political sphere.
                    Although most Malays live in urban areas, they are traditionally associated with the rural hinterland.

                    Malaysian Malays tend to have a fatalistic wordview, leading them to attribute success,opportunity and misfortune to god's will.
                    Besides, care and concern to human interaction may take precedences over deadline and monetary success.
                    Malay culture regards politeness and respect as the main moral values.
                    Most Malaysian Malays tend to be less concerned about economic pursuits than other ethnic groups.
                    However, this had made Malays lack of ambition or even laziness.
                    Rather, it reflects the Malay view that building relationship is particularly important.

                    Malaysian Indians are also the descendants of laborers who immigrated to Malaysia.
                    They had made up 6.7% of Malaysia population.
                    Much of Malaysia's unique Indian culture originates from the Hindus.
                    They brought their traditions, cuisine and ethnic dress to Malaysia.

                    Before independence, many Indian were employed on rubber plantations, 
                    although some worked in other labor categories. For example, the Punjabis work in the police office.
                    Since independence in 1957, many rubber plantation have been closed and many Indians are affected. 
                    Their situation has tended to worsen due to excluded from Bumiputera policies and they were less
                    successful economically and educationally than Chinese.
